# Example Prompts for Reducing Bias in Recruitment AI

## Example 1: Reducing Demographic Bias

**System Prompt:**

**User Prompt (Employer Input):**  
"Please prioritize candidates who demonstrate strong project management skills, leadership experience, and a collaborative approach. Ideal candidates should align with our company’s values of innovation and teamwork."

**Combined Prompt Example:**
